Cryptography projects

[`encrypter`](https://github.com/natashamathur/cryptic/blob/master/encrypter/encrypter.py) - a utility that can encrypt and decrypt a file and generate the cryptographic keys necessary to do so. 
            It is designed to prevent unauthorized read/write access of the encrytped files either by an inside or 
            outside attacker.
